            <h1>THE HEART BEHIND THE PROJECT</h1>
            <p class="c2">
                The break-down diary is designed
                for young people who are
                experiencing chronic pain. This
                diary serves as both a reminder
                that it gets better, but also a blank
                slate to record symptoms and
                feelings over time.
                Our heart behind this project is to
                be able to aid those searching for a
                way to improve their pain
                management- whether that be
                through understanding their body
                better, getting a medical diagnosis,
                or simply to track and
                release their emotions.
                Journals can achieve many of these
                goals, but at the end of the day
                there's only so much we can do. It's
                up to you
                to use this diary and advocate for
                yourself within circles of friends,
                family, and the healthcare system.
                You're not alone in this journey.
            </p>
            <h1>RECORD. REFLECT. RELIEVE</h1>
            <p class="c2">
                Chronic pain affects 1 in 6 young
                adults, even though it is commonly
                associated with ailing older
                demographics.
                Learning to handle chronic pain
                experienced at a young age can
                affect the rest of people's lives- for
                better, or for worse.
            </p>
            <p class="c3">
                This project aims to provide
                resources for young adults who
                experience chronic pain, allowing
                them space to explore and reflect
                on how chronic pain affects their
                lives. An intentionally designed
                blank slate that allows the user to
                explore ways to improve their
                quality of life, as well as analyse
                the impacts of their actions.
            </p>
            <p class="c4">
                Chronic pain doesn't have to be
                a permanent diagnosis.
                But even if it stays, it doesn't
                have to control your life.
                Learning to advocate for yourself,
                and how to handle your life, despite
                the pain, can have massive impacts
                on your outlook on life and your
                physical wellbeing.
                Often in our too-busy world,
                emphasis isn't placed on slowing
                down and managing life well,
                but more about how much you can
                achieve. It doesn't have to be
                this way.
