                <h2>THE HEART BEHIND<br>THIS CAMPAIGN</h2>
                <p>The break-down diary is designed for young people who are experiencing chronic pain. This diary serves as both a reminder that it gets better, but also a blank slate to record symptoms and feelings over time.</p>
                <p>Our heart behind this project is to be able to aid those searching for a way to improve their pain management- whether that be through understanding their body better, getting a medical diagnosis, or simply to track and release their emotions.</p>
                <p>Journals can achieve many of these goals, but at the end of the day there's only so much we can do. It's up to you to use this diary and advocate for yourself within circles of friends, family, and the healthcare system. But you're not alone in this journey.</p>

            <!-- Bottor Right -->
            <div>
                <p>Chronic illnesses an pain are any type of pain that is experienced regularly for three months or longer. Not to be confused with terminal illnesses, different types of chronic pain may be able to be cured, or symptoms subside over time.</p>
                <p>One in six New Zealander's have recorded chronic pain (NZMA, 2011) This is often discussed in relation to middle aged to older adults, as it most prevalently affects them. However, increasing numbers of young adults and teenagers are experiencing chronic pain.</p>
                <p>NZMA data reports 8.6% of 18-24 year Olds experience chronic pain. It is possible that the chronic pain that affects young adults can follow them for the rest of their lives, which is why it's so crucial to learn to manage it early, as well as maintain a positive outlook.</p>
                <p>Given the level of impact that any pain can have in our everyday lives, from lowering activity levels to interrupting university studies and personal relationships, it's important to be able to get medical help alongside doing this diary.</p>
