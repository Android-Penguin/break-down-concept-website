            <h1>WHAT IS CHRONIC PAIN?</h1>
            <p class="c2">
                Chronic pain is any type of pain
                that is experienced regularly for
                three months or longer. Not to be
                confused with terminal illnesses,
                different types of chronic pain may
                be able to be cured, or symptoms
                subside over time.
                One in six New Zealander's have
                recorded chronic pain (NZMA, 2011)
                This is often discussed in relation to
                middle aged to older adults, as it
                most prevalently affects them.
                However, increasing numbers of
                young adults and teenagers are
                experiencing chronic pain.
                NZMA data reports 8.6% of 18-24
                year Olds experience chronic pain.
                It is possible that the chronic pain
                that affects young adults can follow
                them for the rest of their lives,
                which is why it's so crucial to learn
                to manage it early, as well as
                maintain a positive outlook.
                Given the level of impact that any
                pain can have in our everyday lives,
                from lowering activity levels to
                interrupting university studies and
                personal relationships, it's
                important to be able to get medical
                help alongside doing this diary.

            <h1>RECORD. REFLECT. RELIEVE</h1>
            <p class="c2">
                Chronic pain affects 1 in 6 young
                adults, even though it is commonly
                associated with ailing older
                demographics.
                Learning to handle chronic pain
                experienced at a young age can
                affect the rest of people's lives- for
                better, or for worse.
            </p>
            <p class="c3">
                This project aims to provide
                resources for young adults who
                experience chronic pain, allowing
                them space to explore and reflect
                on how chronic pain affects their
                lives. An intentionally designed
                blank slate that allows the user to
                explore ways to improve their
                quality of life, as well as analyse
                the impacts of their actions.
            </p>
            <p class="c4">
                Chronic pain doesn't have to be
                a permanent diagnosis.
                But even if it stays, it doesn't
                have to control your life.
                Learning to advocate for yourself,
                and how to handle your life, despite
                the pain, can have massive impacts
                on your outlook on life and your
                physical wellbeing.
                Often in our too-busy world,
                emphasis isn't placed on slowing
                down and managing life well,
                but more about how much you can
                achieve. It doesn't have to be
                this way.
