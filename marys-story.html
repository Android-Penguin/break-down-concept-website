            <h1>MARY'S JOURNEY</h1>
            <p>
                <br>
                My journey with chronic pain began around
                7 or 8 years ago when I first started getting
                dysmenorrhea. Of course, I didn't know
                that it was chronic pain at the time, only
                something unfamiliar and a monthly event
                that would stop me from going to school,
                social events, and the like for a few days
                out of every month.
                <br><br>
                Although my symptoms werent as bad in
                my preteen years, I remember a being told
                off by my father as he told me that, in the
                future when I was working, I wouldn't be able
                to take 3 days off every month, and I needed
                to get better at managing my symptoms.
                <br><br>
                When I started my degree, I also started
                my journey of being diagnosed with
                endometriosis. This took a long time,
                and required for me to see a lot of
                different people.
                <br><br>
                Often I had just been prescribed different
                OCPS long tern neural-damping pain
                medication, and even an anti-depressant
                class of painkiller that I later found they
                had stopped prescribing it as an
                anti-depressant because it tended
                to have the opposite affect.
                <br><br>
                Having started a symptom diary, this
                greatly helped my communication with
                health professionals because for the first
                time, I wasn't just telling them and they
                were trusting my word, but they could see
                an actual tangible record of my experience.
                <br><br>
                I required three months of a symptom diary
                to get a diagnosis, and in general I found
                it helped rne to recall my own experience
                as I tended to block out and ignore when
                my symptoms were bad, leaving me with a
                warped perception of how well I was
                actually handling my life.

                Unfortunately even<br>
                now, I struggle<br>
                with being able<br>
                to manage all the<br>
                things that I want<br>
                to do, or should<br>
                do, with what I am<br>
                physically capable<br>
                of achieving.
